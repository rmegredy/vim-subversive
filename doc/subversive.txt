INTRODUCTION                                    *subversive*

Subversive provides two new operator motions to make quick substitutions very easy.  It contains no default mappings and will have no affect until you add your own maps to it.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION					*subversive-substitute-motion*

Example config:

    " s for substitute
    nmap s <plug>(SubversiveSubstituteMotion)
    nmap ss <plug>(SubversiveSubstituteLine)
    nmap S <plug>(SubversiveSubstituteToEndOfLine)

Note that in this case you will be shadowing the change character key `s` so you would have to use the longer form `cl`

After adding these maps, you can then execute `s<motion>` to substitute the text object provided by the motion with the contents of the default register (or an explicit register if provided)

SUBSTITUTE OVER RANGE MOTION					*subversive-substitute-over-range-motion*

TBD
